Formal proofs
=============

Overview
--------

This directory contains formally verified proofs of the data structures
implemented in the code.

Building
--------

First, it is required to install [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) along with the
[Iris Framework](https://iris-project.org/). For detailed instuctions on that,
see the description in the repository of Iris
[here](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/blob/master/README.md).

This project was successfully built with version `dev.2020-08-07.0.dc3d182b` of
Iris.

After Iris is installed and the toolchain of Coq is in `$PATH`, run
```sh
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile.coq.local
make -f Makefile.coq.local
```

Structure
---------

### Overview

* `_CoqProject` is the description of the project for the build systems of Coq.
* `theories` is the directory with the source code.

### Theories

* `lib` contains proofs of the structures. Files `$x_impl` contain the concrete
  code that was verified; `$x_spec` describe the desired behavior of that code;
  `$x_proof` ensure that the code meets these expectations.
* `util` contains various useful lemmas about objects that are widely applicable
  and not directly relevant to the subject matter.
